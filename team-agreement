# Group E Team Agreement

## Cooperation Plan

## Member strengths and weaknesses

(see the Work Plan for how strengths will be utilized.)

Dennis strengths: Javascript

Dennis weaknesses: Design and CSS

Casey strengths: CSS, presentations, quick typist, prior computer experience.

Casey weaknesses: javascript, talking about self, and local storage.

Chris strengths: Communication, presentation, pre-planning, project management.

Chris weaknesses: "Craft competency" and "results competency" visualization of what future steps will need to be taken to achieve goal.

Isaiah strengths: Communication, presentation, CSS.

Isaiah weaknesses: "Craft competency" javascript.

## Conflict Plan

All members are expected to have some degree of "elasticity" for project roles. If someone gets roadblocked entirely on a section, others should be willing to "tag in" to take over a particularly difficult segment.

Prioritization will be established on what aspects of the project are vital, vs "icing" and achieving MVP for the project takes priority. Larger communication issues and group problems will be raised with TAs, or instructor if needed.

## Communication Plan

Primary method of communication will be done through the REMO table 11 voice and video call system, while a secondary communication for text provided by a group slack conversation already established.

Commenting of code is expected, and each code segment should have at least a laconic description of what it is or does.

Daily check-in for what our plans are for the day, and what we intend to work on or achieve.

Allowances will be made if both parties are willing to allow shadowing.

## Work Plan

WEEKEND WORK WILL BE GREATLY DISCOURAGED, but if a member decides that they would like to willingly contribute over the weekend. Members are free to reach out and send questions or messages outside of class-time hours, *however* no expectation of a response until the next class period will be allowed. You can work over the weekend, but don't *expect* anyone else to.

A consensus has already been reached among the team that we have a dedicated "quiet solo" work time to allow for deep focus work. Communication needed for questions during these periods will be done either through the REMO workspace, or the slack group chat.

Dennis' planned role: Building the main javascript logic behind the landing page, and the battle system page, in collaboration with any other members who will assist.

Casey's planned role: Laying out the main CSS for most pages, and setting up the overall look feel and colorscheme of the site.

Chris' planned role: Presentation, project management, "navigator" role for JS/CSS, writing assistance.

Isaiah's planned role: Secondary to CSS styling and color scheme and Javascript logic.

## Git Process

Basic rules of branching and not committing to main without having 2 person review are in effect for this project, with at least one branch created per person per day. Merges and pull requests will only be done for features that are confirmed functional when stand-alone, and nothing that requires a "future" thing to be created to function at all will be allowed onto main.
